### Moveit to Azure File Share for Data storage to capture logs for Monitoring and Reporting in PBI

1. **MoveIt Transfer Task to SFTP: Upload MuleSoft Logs**
   - **Details**: MoveIt Transfer Task is responsible for securely transferring MuleSoft logs to the SFTP server. 
   - **Actions**:
     - MoveIt periodically checks for new log files generated by MuleSoft.
     - When logs are detected, MoveIt securely uploads the logs to the SFTP server.

2. **SFTP Server to Azure File Share: Store MuleSoft Logs**
   - **Details**: The SFTP server writes logs directly to an Azure File Share, which acts as a staging area for further processing.
   - **Actions**:
     - Logs are securely stored in an Azure File Share via the SFTP server.
     - Azure File Share provides scalable and secure storage for collected logs, ready for further processing.

3. **Azure Function Timer Trigger: Copy Logs to Azure Blob Storage**
   - **Details**: An Azure Function with a Timer Trigger is set to run every minute to check the Azure File Share for new log files.
   - **Actions**:
     - The Azure Function copies new logs from Azure File Share to Azure Blob Storage.
     - Azure Blob Storage serves as the data source for subsequent processing steps.

4. **Azure Function Blob Trigger: Parse Logs and Publish to Service Bus or Event Hub**
   - **Details**: An Azure Function with a Blob Trigger is activated when new log files are uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.
   - **Actions**:
     - The Azure Function reads and parses the log files to extract relevant information.
     - The parsed data is then published to either Azure Service Bus or Azure Event Hub for downstream processing.

5. **Azure Function Event Hub Trigger: Process Data and Write to Azure SQL Database or CosmosDB**
   - **Details**: An Azure Function with an Event Hub Trigger is used to consume data from Azure Event Hub.
   - **Actions**:
     - The Azure Function reads the incoming events and processes them as needed.
     - Based on the data, the function writes the processed data to either an Azure SQL Database or CosmosDB, depending on the use case (relational or NoSQL).

6. **Power BI (PBI): Query Data for Reporting**
   - **Details**: Power BI connects to Azure SQL Database or CosmosDB using data connectors to generate visual reports and dashboards.
   - **Actions**:
     - Power BI retrieves data from Azure SQL Database or CosmosDB using appropriate queries.
     - Dynamic reports and dashboards are created to provide insights into MuleSoft logs and other relevant metrics.

7. **Access Control via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - **Details**: Access to Azure resources such as Blob Storage, Event Hub, SQL Database, CosmosDB, and Power BI is controlled via Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
   - **Actions**:
     - RBAC ensures that only authorized users and applications have access to sensitive data and resources.
     - Policies are configured to grant appropriate permissions based on roles (e.g., Reader, Contributor, Owner).

### Step 3: **Azure Function Timer Trigger: Copy Logs to Azure Blob Storage**

#### Setup Instructions:
1. **Create an Azure Storage Account for Blob Storage**:
   - In the Azure Portal, create a new **Storage Account**.
   - Under the storage account, create a **Blob Container** (e.g., `logs-container`).

2. **Create an Azure Function App**:
   - In the Azure Portal, create a **Function App** that supports your desired runtime stack (e.g., .NET, Python).
   - Under the Function App, create a new **Timer Trigger** function.

3. **Configure the Timer Trigger**:
   - Set the timer trigger schedule to `0 */1 * * * *` (every minute).
   - Write code to copy files from Azure File Share to Azure Blob Storage. Use the Azure SDK to list files in the file share and copy them to the blob container.

4. **Deploy and Test the Function**:
   - Deploy the function and test to ensure it correctly copies files from the file share to blob storage.

    TimerFunc->>Blob: Copy logs to Azure Blob Storage
    Note over Blob: Logs stored in Azure Blob Storage
```

---

### Step 4: **Azure Function Blob Trigger: Parse Logs and Publish to Service Bus or Event Hub**

#### Setup Instructions:
1. **Create a Blob Trigger Function**:
   - In the existing **Function App**, create a new **Blob Trigger** function.
   - Configure it to trigger when new blobs are added to the `logs-container`.

2. **Write Code to Parse and Publish Data**:
   - Write the function code to read the blob contents, parse the logs, and extract necessary information.
   - Use Azure SDK to publish the parsed data to **Service Bus** or **Event Hub**.

3. **Deploy and Test the Function**:
   - Deploy the function and test by uploading a log file to the blob container to ensure it triggers correctly and publishes to Service Bus or Event Hub.

    Blob-->>BlobFunc: Read and parse log file
    BlobFunc->>SBorEH: Publish parsed data to Service Bus/Event Hub
    Note over SBorEH: Data ready for downstream processing
```

---

### Step 5: **Azure Function Event Hub Trigger: Process Data and Write to Azure SQL Database or CosmosDB**

#### Setup Instructions:
1. **Create an Event Hub or Service Bus Trigger Function**:
   - In the **Function App**, create a new **Event Hub Trigger** or **Service Bus Trigger** function.
   - Configure it to listen to the **Service Bus** or **Event Hub** queue/topic where parsed data is published.

2. **Write Code to Process Data and Write to Database**:
   - Use Azure SDK to connect to **Azure SQL Database** or **CosmosDB**.
   - Write code to insert or upsert the processed data into the database.

3. **Deploy and Test the Function**:
   - Deploy the function and test by sending data through Service Bus or Event Hub to ensure it processes and writes correctly to the database.

### Step 6: **Power BI (PBI): Query Data for Reporting**

#### Setup Instructions:
1. **Configure Power BI Data Connectors**:
   - Open **Power BI Desktop** and use **Azure SQL Database** or **CosmosDB** connectors to connect to your data source.
   - Authenticate using Azure Active Directory credentials.

2. **Create Reports and Dashboards**:
   - Use Power BI’s interface to create dynamic visualizations, reports, and dashboards based on the data.
   - Publish the reports to the **Power BI Service**.

3. **Set Up Refresh Schedules**:
   - Configure data refresh schedules in Power BI to ensure real-time

 or near-real-time reporting.

### Step 7: **Access Control via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

#### Setup Instructions:
1. **Configure RBAC for Each Azure Resource**:
   - For **Azure Blob Storage, File Share, Event Hub, SQL Database, CosmosDB,** and **Power BI**, assign roles like **Reader**, **Contributor**, and **Owner** as appropriate.
   - Use **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** to create security groups and assign these groups to specific roles for fine-grained access control.

2. **Ensure Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Regularly review and audit access to ensure compliance with security best practices.
